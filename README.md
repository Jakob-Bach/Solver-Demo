# Solver Demo

## Setup

### Python Code

We use `Python 3.8.3` (in particular, out of `Anaconda3 2019.10`) with [`conda 4.8.3`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) dependency management.
For reproducibility purposes, we exported our environment with `conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml`.
You should be able to import the environment via `conda env create -f environment.yml`
and then activate it with `conda activate solver-demo`.
After activating, call `ipython kernel install --user --name=solver-demo` to make the environment available for notebooks.
